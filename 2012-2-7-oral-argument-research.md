# Locke (Plaintiff’s Memorandum Opposing Motion)

## Ashlock v. Norris, 475 N.E.2d 1167
- Facts:
	- furnishee was stumbling
	- Cindy Morrow (furnishee) ordered tequila mixed drink (like rum punch!), and later some shots from Norris (furnisher)
	- hours later Morrow fell, regained her footing with help from Morris
- Held:
	- dispute must be made in good faith to bar summary judgment
	- furnishee's stumbling raised material fact as to whether furnisher knew furnishee was intoxicated
	- any doubt as to fact, or an inference to be drawn is to be resolved in favor of party opposing motion
	- no summary judgment where info before court reveals good-faith dispute over inferences
	- factors to determine furnisher's knowledge include:
		- what and how much
		- time involved
		- behavior
		- condition
- buzzwords: gratuitous furnishing
- Similar:
	- **both furnishees fell** and were "out of control"
		- madison was loud and knocked over pretzels, cindy dropped purse and just sat on the ground to pick up contents
	- **type**: both furnishess were drinking heavy alcohol. madison was drinking rum punch the whole time. cindy drank mixed tequila drinks and shots. in this case, the "type and quantity" factors even skew a little more towards madison as there is an inference that could be made that sweet mixed drinks encourage themselves to be consumed in greater volumes.
	- both furnishers were no distinterested bystanders
	- both furnishers were in the **proximity of furnishee**, just a difference of possible distance; argument of degree

## Baxter v. Galligher, 604 N.E.2d 1245
- Facts:
	- Baxter injured during birthday party at Ghalliger residence
	- Walters through keys at Parrish during horseplay, struck Baxter in the eye
- Held:
	- acting like you're having a good time != visible intox.
- Different:
	- no evidence presented to show visible intoxication, very solid evidence for madison on the other hand

## Booker, Inc. v. Morrill, 639 N.E.2d 358
- Facts:
	- two men play drunken pool in the morning at a bar
	- 8-10 beers and 3 shots of peppermint schnapps
	- Morril drives home, crashes, died
	- BAC 0.21%
	- Expert testimony that anyone with 0.21% BAC will exhibit physical signs of intox
		- stumbling, exaggerated emotional state
	- bartenders admitted to observing Morrill, but said he didn't appear intoxicates
- Held:
	- trier of fact may rely on reas. inferences to determine actual knowledge of vis. intox
	- evidence is relevant if it has a logical tendency to prove material fact
		- **BAC has tendency to prove vis. intox.**

## Buffington v. Metcalf, 883 F.Supp. 194
- summary j denied
- Pedestrian buffington struck by drunk driver, D
- provider claimed to not observe anything unusual
- Held:
	- provider's knowledge is an issue of fact
	- fact can be determined by **inferences** from the magic factors (time and quantity etc)
		- in this case quantity evidence was sufficient
	- **"see no evil defense"** not enough to establish absence of actual knowledge

## Culver v. McRoberts, 192 F.3d 1095
- affirmed grant of sum j
- sailboat drinking
- 40 foot yacht
- 10-12 guests, mixed their own drinks
- P alleges no actual observation on part of D
- no metaphysical doubts to bar sum j
- **subjective standard** (not objective)
- no constcutive actual knowledge of vis. intox.
- **personal service** and **opportunity to observe** are key factors

## Delta Tau Delta v. Johnson, 712 N.E.2d 968
- Motz sex. assaulted P after drinking at DTD house
- Motz was seen drinking from a cup and talked a little more than normal, but didnt show other signs of vis. intox.
- subjective standard for actual knowledge
	- reasonable inferences
	- actual knowledge can be inferred from the magical factors
- insufficient evidence for actual knowledge allows for sum j to stand

## Elsperman v. Plump, 446 N.E.2d 1027
- car crash where P died allegedly as result of bartender's neg.
- kind of an empty case...maybe just leave it alone?
